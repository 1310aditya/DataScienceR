## Introduction to dplyr for Faster Data Manipulation in R

This tutorial is based on Kevin Markham's dplyr tutorial (https://github.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial). He has created a [40-minute video tutorial](http://youtu.be/jWjqLW-u3hc) introducing Hadley Wickham's excellent [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) package.

I have modified his R markdown document to add a few more functions and added it here.

More information about the original tutorial is available on [his blog](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/).
